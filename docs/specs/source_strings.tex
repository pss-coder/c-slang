Strings are of the form \texttt{"}$ \textit{double-quote-characters} $\texttt{"},
where $\textit{double-quote-characters}$ is a possibly empty sequence of characters without
the character \texttt{"} and without the newline character, 
of the form
\texttt{'}$ \textit{single-quote-characters} $\texttt{'},
where $\textit{single-quote-characters}$ is a possibly empty sequence of characters without
the character~\texttt{'} and without the newline character,
and of the form
\texttt{`}$ \textit{backquote-characters} $\texttt{`},
where $\textit{backquote-characters}$ is a possibly empty sequence of characters without
the character~\texttt{`}. Note that newline characters are allowed as
$\textit{backquote-characters}$.

The following characters can be represented in strings as given:
\begin{itemize}
\item horizontal tab: \verb#\t#
\item vertical tab: \verb#\v#
\item nul char:  \verb#\0#
\item backspace:  \verb#\b#
\item form feed:  \verb#\f#
\item newline:  \verb#\n#
\item carriage return:  \verb#\r#
\item single quote:  \verb#\'#
\item double quote:  \verb#\"#
\item backslash:  \verb#\\#
\end{itemize}
Unicode characters can be used in strings using \verb#\u# followed by the hexadecimal representation
of the unicode character, for example \lstinline{'\uD83D\uDC04'}.
